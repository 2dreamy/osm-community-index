    "extendedDescription": "This group is intended to support and integrate regions in East, Southeast, and South Asia that do not have their own local communities. We also hope that we can jointly solve problems in regions that do not have local communities and cannot respond to them. Some topic rooms allow native languages for those who have difficulty with English."
